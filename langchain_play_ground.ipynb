Then there's \"Technical Product Manager\" at Meituan from Sep 2022 - Sep 2023. After that, there's \"Senior Product Manager\" at Alibaba Group from Sep 2018 - Sep 2022.\n",

      "Wait, the Senior Product Manager role at Alibaba ended in Sep 2022, and then Meituan from Sep 2022 - Sep 2023, and then the current role at University of Galway. So the last job before the current one would be at Meituan.\n",
